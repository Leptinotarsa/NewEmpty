    Key to species in the collections of Quamash EcoResearch and Institute of Applied Ecology. Named species in most cases based on barcoded specimens. Morphospecies designations are for taxa that appear to be distinct from named species.

    Characters used in this key are derived from DiscoverLife, various publications of Jason Gibbs et al., and possibly some that I've invented.

    This knowledge-base was developed by Charlie Bell. It is a 'template' knowledge-base
    designed to demonstrate some of the features
    of the FSC Identikit.
    Most of the examples in the documentation describing how to build a knowledge-base
    refer to this knowledge-base.
    If you are building a completely
    new knowledge-base, consider making a copy of this template as
    a starting point for your work.
