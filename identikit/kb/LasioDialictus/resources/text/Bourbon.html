        The Bourbon biscuit (sometimes referred to as a Bourbon cream) is a
        sandwich style biscuit consisting of two thin rectangular dark
        chocolate flavoured biscuits with a chocolate buttercream filling.

        The biscuit was introduced in 1910 (originally under the name "Creola")
        by the biscuit company Peek Freans, of Bermondsey, London, originator of
        the Garibaldi biscuit. The new name was taken from the European royal
        House of Bourbon. The Bourbon biscuit is the fifth most popular
        biscuit in the UK to dunk into tea.

        Many other companies make their own version of the biscuit under the
        "Bourbon" name, including major supermarkets.
