    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This is an example of the type of 'HTML' file we can use to display information on taxa.
        This file is  linked on the 'media' worksheet of the buiscuits knowledge-base
        to the 'Rich Highland Shortie' taxon. So in the visualisation you can see it by using
        either the 'full details' visualisation from the drop-down menu, or by invoking the
        full details dialog from and looking on the 'details tab' (for the 'Rich Highland Shortie').
    </p>
    <p>
        The file itself is called 'template.html' and is in the 'resources/text' folder under
        the 'biscuits' knowledge-base folder.
    </p>
    <h2>Headers and paragraphs</h2>
    <p>
        You can used header tags to separate content into sections. Here we're using 'h2' (header 2nd level)
        tags and you can also use h3 and h4 levels for sub-headings. h1 tags are best avoided as they
        look too prominent within the context of the FSC Identikit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use 'p' tags (paragraphs) to delineate separate paragraphs. Text can be <b>emboldened</b> by
        surrounding it with 'b' tags or <i>italicised</i> by surrounding it with 'i' tags.
    </p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>
        You can create unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered) lists like this:
        <ul>
            <li>Unordered list item 1</li>
            <li>Unordered list item 2</li>
            <li>Unordered list item 3</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Ordered list item 1</li>
            <li>Ordered list item 2</li>
            <li>Ordered list item 3</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>
        You can link to other web pages by using the 'a' tag. For instance, this would
        create a link to the <a href="http://www.fscbiodiversity.uk/"></a>FSC Biodiversity Projects</a>
        website around the phrase 'FSC Biodiversity Projects'.
    </p>
    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>
        You are strongly advised to avoid using images in these textual information files since
        they can too easily unbalance the visualisations. Images should be referenced in the
        'media' tab of the knowledge-base and handled separately by Identikit.
    </p>
    <h2>Editors</h2>
    <p>
        You can use any plain text editor to create HTML files with these simple tags, e.g.
        Microsoft's Notepad. I recommend an excellent lightweight editor called Notepad++
        (<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.6.html">https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.6.html</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        You are advised to avoid using heavyweight editors such as Microsoft Word which can
        save files in 'HTML' format since they add a lot of markup and additional information which
        is not necessary and can also adversely affect the appearance of the end result in the Identikit.
    </p>
    <h2>Further information on HTML markup</h2>
    <p>
        There are enless web resources on HTML markup if you are interested in learning more than
        the very basics presented here. This is a good one:
