    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Pre-heat the oven to gas mark 4/350F/180C.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix together all of the dry ingredients and rub in the butter to a breadcrumb texture. Now add enough milk to create a moist pastry consistency. Refrigerate for 15 minutes to firm the mix.
            </li>
            <li>
                This creates a reasonably delicate dough so it's important to roll between the sheets of cling film with great care. When 3mm thick cut into 6-7cm discs re-rolling any trimmings.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the discs on a lightly greased baking sheet and bake in the pre-heated oven for 15-20 minutes, until lightly browned and firm to the touch.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the oven and leave to rest for five minutes before transferring onto a wire rack.
            </li>
        </ul>  
    </p>

        The digestives are now best kept in an airtight container and eaten within 2-3 days. However, once you have made them, it is very rare they last that long!
