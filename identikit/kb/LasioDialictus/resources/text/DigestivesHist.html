        McVitie & Price's first major biscuit was the McVitie's Digestive, the first ever digestive biscuit, created by young new employee Alexander Grant in 1892. The biscuit was given its name because it was thought that its high baking soda content served as an aid to food digestion.

        Grant was later to become head of the concern, during which time he was in 1923 the chief benefactor of the then-new National Library of Scotland. Grant then donated another substantial sum in 1928 when the National Library was expanded to occupy the Sheriff Court buildings on George IV Bridge.

        The McVitie's Chocolate Homewheat Digestive was created in 1925. Over 71 million packets of McVitie's chocolate digestives are eaten in the United Kingdom each year, giving an average of 52 biscuits per second.
