<h3>Overview of FSC Identikit</h3>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##resources/fsc-logo.jpg" style="float: right; width: 250px" />
    The FSC Identikit is an open-source project - originally an output of the FSC's 
    Tomorrow's Biodiversity project funded by Esmee Fairbairn 
    between 2013 and 2017 inclusive. Esmee Fairbairn provided extension funding 
    for 2018 to roll the Identikit into the new HLF-funded FSC BioLinks 
    project which runs from 2018 to 2022 inclusive. FSC Identikit will 
    therefore be supported and developed by FSC until at least 2022.

<p>
    Multi-access keys (also known as lateral keys) are a way of using an
    underlying taxonomic (morphological) knowledge-base as an aid to identification
    of biological specimens. There is normally a very clear separation between the
    representation of knowledge (i.e the knowledge-base) and the tools (software) that
    use and present that knowledge as a key.
</p>
<p>
    As the  project progressed, it became clear that a taxonomic
    knowledge-base can be used as an aid to identification in lots of ways - not just
    as the engine of a multi-access key. I started to think about representing and <i>visualising</i>
    knowledge-bases in many different ways in order to explore the potential of transferring the
    knowledge contained within them to the people that use them.
</p>
<p>
    The essence of this project is to create a technical environment - including a software framework -
    in which imaginative ideas for visualising and using taxonomic
    knowledge-bases for identification can be realised.
</p>
<h3>Getting involved</h3>
<p>
    There are many ways to engage with this project. All of the source code developed for it
    is publicly available as an open source project
    <a href="https://github.com/burkmarr/tombiovis">https://github.com/burkmarr/tombiovis</a>.
    Some ways to engage are described below.
</p>
<h4>Use the visualisations we publish </h4>
<img src="##tombiopath##resources/tombio.png" style="float: right; width: 100px" />
<p>
    We have published a number
    of Identikit ID resources on our website
    (frequently in partnership with other parties providing the knowledge-bases). We very
    much hope that these, in themselves,
    will be useful resources to people identifying the taxa we have covered.
</p>
<p>
    As well as working on new knowledge-bases, we are thinking of new ways to visualise and
    use those knowledge-bases all the time and we intend to add
    more tools to the Identikit - enriching
    the way in which knowledge-bases connected to it can be used and visualised.
</p>
<h4>Develop your own taxonomic knowledge-bases</h4>
<img src="##tombiopath##resources/kb.png" style="float: right; width: 250px" />
<p>
    You can develop new ID resources, including multi-access keys, without doing any programming at
    all by developing your own knowledge-bases using an Excel spreadsheet template that is
    published with the open source software on GitHub.
</p>
<p>
    Choose whatever taxonomic group interests
    you and populate the spreadsheet with the morphological character states describing the taxa in
    that group. Then you can take the existing visualisation Identikit tools and use them with your
    new knowledge-base - either on your own website on
    as a stand-alone implementation on one or more computers.
</p>
<h4>Collaborate with us to develop new knowledge-bases</h4>
<p>
    If you have, or are developing, a taxonomic knowledge-base
    that you believe would benefit from some collaboration with us, then please
    contact <a href="mailto: r.burkmar@field-studies-council.org">Rich Burkmar</a>
    to talk about the possibilities.
</p>
<p>
    In many cases we will be happy to guide you on the production/format of the knowledge-base
    and host the visualisations on our website.
</p>

<h4>Collaborate with us to develop new Identikit code</h4>
<img src="##tombiopath##resources/github-logo.png" style="float: right; width: 250px" />
<p>
    One of the main reasons that we publish the source code behind the Identikit
    project on GitHub - a well established hub for co-operative open source software development - is
    to provide the opportunity for collaborative working with other Javascript programmers eager
    to explore the potential of these kinds of tools. GitHub provides the environment and tools
    required to facilitate this kind of collaborative coding.
</p>
<h4>Use the Identikit code as a starting point for your own work</h4>
<p>
    Because the Identikit project is truly open source, anyone is welcome to take copies
    of the code and do with it as they wish, including developing their own proprietary products
    if they so desire.
</p>

<h3>A note on the technology</h3>
<img src="##tombiopath##resources/data-driven-documents.png" style="float: right; width: 250px" />
<p>
    The Identikit is built using standard web technologies supported
    by all modern browsers. No plugins are required. The programming language
    is Javascript. Two Javascript libraries, in particular, help to provide the look and feel
    of this visualisation:
    <ul>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">
            The open source <a href="https://jqueryui.com/" target="_blank">jQuery UI library</a>
            has been used to help provide much of the user interface.
        </li>
        <li>
            Binding graphic elements (e.g. the taxon rectangles) to the underlying knowledge-base
            and providing the animation in response to user input is achieved using
            <a href="http://d3js.org/"><em>Data Driven Documents (D3)</em></a> which
            is an open-source Javascript library developed
            by <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/">Mike Bostock</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Both of these libraries make heavy use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and D3, in particular,
    relies on Scaleable Vector Graphics (SVG).
</p>
<p>
    The current Identikit tools have been optimised for large format web-browsers, e.g. those that run
    on laptops. It will be possible to develop new visualisations that are optimised for
    all sorts of different devices including smartphones and this is a goal of development
    during 2018.
