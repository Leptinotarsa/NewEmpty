<h2>The Earthworm multi-access key</h2>
<p>
    This visualisation was originally created before the general Tom.bio visualisation framework was constructed.
    It is somewhat similar to the general two-column key visualisation, but with some key differences which
    make this particularly suitable for working with earthworms. It has been ported into the general Tom.bio
    visualisation framework so that it can be used alongside the general framework visualisations, enabling
    people to use all to their best advantage.

    <p>
        This is a visualisation of a morphological knowledge-base for British earthworms. The knowledge
        base is drawn from Emma Sherlock's FSC AIDGAP publication,
        <a href="http://www.field-studies-council.org/publications/pubs/earthworms.aspx" target="_blank">
            <span class="booklink">Key to the earthworms of UK and Ireland</span>
        </a>. The visualisation
        is designed to function effectively as a multi-access key, as well as being a useful
        way to explore the knowledge base and assimilate knowledge from it.
    </p>
    <p>
        This visualisation does not reproduce all the information found within Emma Sherlock's key.
        With more information on ecology,
        collecting, sampling, curation and further information on identification not reproduced here, the
        <a href="http://www.field-studies-council.org/publications/pubs/earthworms.aspx" target="_blank">
            <span class="booklink">Key to the earthworms of UK and Ireland</span>
        </a> is an indispensable book for anyone seriously interested in earthworm recording
        in the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
        The FSC Tomorrow's Biodiversity project (Tom.bio) is working with the Earthworm Society of Britain (ESB) to
        promote earthworm recording in the UK, e.g. by supporting the ESB training programme. Tom.bio is
        also exploring ways of visualising and using taxonomic knowledge-bases. Producing this
        visualisation was a natural step in keeping with both projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        The morphological illustrations in help pages were produced by Charlie Bell.

<h3>Using this visualisation and multi-access key</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        The best way to find out how this visualisation works is to play with it! But it's worth
        having a quick read here in case you miss something that it is capable of.
    </p>
    <h4>Info button</h4>
    <img src="##tombiopath##visEarthworm2/resources/info-button.png" style="float: right; padding: 0 0 10px 10px" />
    <p>
        You've already clicked the Info button if you're reading this! The dialog invoked by this
        button gives a general overview of this visualisation: its purpose, implementation
        and goals.
    </p>
    <h4>Morphological character input</h4>
    <p>
        These controls allow you to specify combinations of morphological character states.
        Some of the character inputs are drop-down lists that you can click on and select from. Most are
        'spinners' that allow you to specify a numerical character by clicking on the up and down arrows.
        You can also type values directly into these boxes.
    </p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##visEarthworm2/resources/character-input.png" style="width: 500px; padding: 0px 0 0px 0" />
    <p>
        In the example shown above, only one character - head shape - has been specified. The state specified
        is 'Tanylobic'. To the immediate right of these controls are listed all the species which are still
        potential 'matches' for the characters specified - the 'possible species'.
        To the immediate right of these are all the species
        which are considered unlikely matches based on the specified characters - the 'unlikely species'.
    </p>
    <p>
        Species are moved from the 'possible species' to the 'unlikely species' based on a couple of criteria.
        Firstly if either the head shape or setae spacing characters are specified and do not match
        the species. Secondly if any 'segment characters' are
        specified (these are the characters from male pore to TP end) and the 'segment difference' for any one
        of these exceeds the specified tolerance. (For more details, see the <a href="#segdiff">section below</a>.)
        Note that species are never moved to the 'unlikely species' based on size characters (diameter or length)
        since these are so variable, but specified values will affect the order in which species are ranked in
        both lists.
    </p>
    <p>
        Within each of the lists - 'possible species' and 'unlikely species' - species are ranked based on how
        well they match the specified characters, with the closest matches nearest the top. Species are ranked based
        on the following criteria, in order of priority.
        <ol>
            <li>Matches for the head type and setae spacing characters</li>
            <li>The sum of all the segment difference values (lower values reflect better matches)</li>
            <li>
                For size characters, the sum of the percentage difference between the specified size
                and the minimum or maximum values in the specified range for each species
                (lower values reflect better matches)
            </li>
        </ol>
        Colours of indicator circles are visual cues to how well a character for any species matches the
        specified value. Matches are shown as blue and non-matches are shown as vermillion. For numeric characters
        intermediate shades reflect how far away from the specified value each species is.
    </p>
    <p>
        Immediately to the right of the text 'Possible species' is an icon which serves as a visual
        cue to the confidence that can be placed in a determination based on the number of
        characters specified. Click this symbol for a more in-depth explanation.
    </p>
    <h4><a name="segdiff">Segment difference scores and tolerance</a></h4>
    <p>
        <img src="##tombiopath##visEarthworm2/resources/segdiff.png" style="float: right; padding: 0 0 10px 10px" />
        For each 'segment character' specified (e.g. male pore or clitellum start), a 'difference value'
        is calculated for each species representing how far the specified value is outside the allowable
        range for that species. (Where the value is within the allowed range, the difference value will be zero.)
        Hold the mouse over an indicator circle to see the difference value for any segment character
        as shown above. The sum of all segment different values is shown to the right of the species name in
        bold type - the lower the value, the closer the species is to the specified segment character values.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the Options button to invoke a dialog where a 'tolerance' value can be specified. When the
        tolerance value is exceeded by the difference value for any segment character, the species is moved
        from the 'possible species' column to the 'unlikely species' column of the display. (A species
        will be moved to the 'unlikely species' column if it does not match the specified head shape
        or setae spacing - regardless of any segment difference values.)
    </p>
    <p>
        By default, the tolerance value is set to 2.
    </p>
    <h4>Help on morphological characters</h4>
    <img src="##tombiopath##visEarthworm2/resources/character-help.png" style="float: right; padding: 0 0 10px 10px" />
    <p>
        Move your mouse over the text labels associated with any of the morphological character input
        controls and you will see the label turn vermilion (red) and the mouse cursor change to an arrow with
        a question mark. By clicking your mouse over the label you will invoke a help dialog that
        explains and illustrates the morphological character.
    </p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##visEarthworm2/resources/help-dialog.png" style="width: 500px; padding: 0px 0 0px 0" />
    <p>
        The help dialog is always shown with the tab corresponding to the morphological character you clicked
        pre-selected, but you can view the help associated with any character by selecting the
        appropriate tab.
    </p>
    <h4>Colouring taxa by knowledge-base character</h4>
    <img src="##tombiopath##visEarthworm2/resources/colour-by-dropdown.png" style="width: 150px; float: right; padding: 0 0 10px 10px" />
    <p>
        Another way of visualising characters in the knowledge base is by colouring the species based on their
        character states. The drop-down 'Colour by' list (right) shows what characters
        be used in this way. Some of them, e.g. family and ecological group, are not morphological
        characters available as part of the multi-access key. Others are characters which can also be
        used/visualised as part of the multi-access key.
    </p>
    <p>
        When species are coloured, a key appears below the 'Colour by' drop-down list explaining what
        each colour means. Categorical character states, e.g. those for ecological group or head type, are each
        denoted by a unique colour. For species that have two possible states against a single character,
        each is coloured using a blend of the two corresponding colours.
    </p>
    <p>
        Numerical character
        states are depicted by a colour on a scale that grades between two colours - the two colours
        represent the extremes - min and max - of the possible values for the character state across all species.
        Taxa that record a numerical state as a single value are represented by a single colour
        in this range. Species that record a numerical state as a range of possible values are
        coloured using a blend of the two colours representing the extremes of that range.
    </p>
    <p>
        The colours are generally arbitrary except for the earthworm 'Colour' character for which
        colours have been chosen to (very roughly) reflect the character states.
    </p>
    <h4>Interacting with species</h4>
    <img src="##tombiopath##visEarthworm2/resources/interactive-taxa.png" style="width: 150px; float: right; padding: 0 0 10px 10px" />
    <p>
        Species are represented by rectangles. In their default - unexpanded - state, each rectangle
        contains the name of the species and a series of circles each corresponding to a character
        that can be used in the multi-access key. When multi-access key characters are set, then
        the circle corresponding to that character turns either blue (for taxa that match that
        character state value) or vermilion (for taxa that don't match) or something in between
        for numeric characters. Circles for which a character
        state has not been specified in the multi-access key are white.
    </p>
    <p>
        From left to right, the character state circles correspond to the list of characters that
        can be used in the multi-access key, from top to bottom. This relationship is more
        explicit for expanded taxa. To expand a species, simply click on it. The height of the
        rectangle expands to show the state of each character recorded in the knowledge-base
        for that species. If you click on the species again, the rectangle contracts. (If the
        'wrong' rectangle expands/contracts when you click your mouse, just move the
        mouse cursor a bit before clicking.)
    </p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##visEarthworm2/resources/info.png" style="width: 20px; float: left; padding: 5px 10px 10px 0" />
    <p>
        When expanded, a small 'info' icon appears at the top-right of the species. If you click this
        a dialog appears showing further information for the selected species (see below), or if the
        dialog is already opened for another species, it is updated to reflect the current species.
    </p>
    <h4>Species information dialog</h4>
    <p>
        The species information dialog has two tabs; the first shows distribution maps and the second
        points to where you can get more information on the selected species (including relevant page
        numbers from Emma Sherlock's FSC AIDGAP key).
    </p>
    <p>
        The maps on the first tab are delivered via an NBN Gateway web service - so they show
        the latest data that are publicly available on the Gateway. The map can be tailored via
        two drop-down lists. The first allows a choice of map backgrounds: no background, 100 km squares
        or Vice County boundaries (the last for Britain only).
    </p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##visEarthworm2/resources/details-dialog.png" style="width: 150px; float: right; padding: 0 0 10px 10px" />
    <p>
        The second drop-down list allows you
        to restrict the data used to generate the map. The current default is to use all publicly available
        datasets.
        You can also restrict datasets to those administered by the Earthworm Society of Britain.
        <!--Optionally you can also restrict data to one of two specific datasets:-->
        <ul>
            <!--<li style="padding-bottom: 20px">
                OPAL: this is the NBN dataset <a href="https://data.nbn.org.uk/Datasets/GA000910" target="_blank">

                    England collected by Citizen Scientists in the OPAL Soil and Earthworm Survey (March 2009 to November 2012)'

            </li>-->
            <!--<li>

            <!--</ul>
            </li>-->
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Earthworms are very under-recorded in the UK. One of the aims of the Earthworm Society of
        Britain is to address this shortfall.
