        The confidence indicator is a coarse visual cue indicative of the confidence
        you can ascribe to a determination based on the number of characters used.
        If you specify few characters, the indicator will tend towards vermillion (red). If you specify
        lots, it will tend towards blue.

    <p>
        Although, in some cases, it is possible to identify an earthworm based on very few
        morphological characters, you should always compare as many characters of your
        specimen as possible against those recorded for the species.
    </p>
    <p>
        Earthworms vary. For example they can be damaged in life and regenerate parts
        of themselves. So sometimes extra segments can be present - or missing - leading
        to character states that differ from the more typical
        examples described in the knowledge base. In other cases, segments can just
        be difficult to distinguish. To guard against these situations, you should always
        check as many characters as possible in order to give yourself the best chance
        of recognising atypical specimens for what they are.

        Ideally you should always check your determinations against the full species
        accounts in Emma Sherlock's key.
