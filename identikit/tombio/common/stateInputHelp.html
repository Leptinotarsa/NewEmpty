<h2>Character state input</h2>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##common/character-input.png" style="float: right; width: 250px" />
    Every character in the knowledge-base marked for use in visualisations
    is represented as a character state input control down the left-hand
    side of the visualisation. These are grouped, as specified in the knowledge-base, into sets
    of related characters.
</p>
<p>
    Each of these sets is represented by a vertically aligned tab on the far left and you can
    select any of these tabs to see only those characters in the specified group. The <b>All</b>
    group, which appears at the top, allows you to display all characters at once.
</p>
<p>
    When the <b>All</b> group is displayed, you can see the <b>show/hide unused characters</b> selection buttons
    and the <b>Reset all</b> button. Selecting <b>hide</b> removes any input controls for unspecified
    characters from the <b>All</b> tab. This is a really convenient way of quickly seeing what characters
    have been specified when there are many available. The <b>Reset all</b> button is a quick way of
    clearing all character input rather than resetting them one at a time.
</p>
<p>
    The are two main types of character input control - <b>text</b> and <b>numeric</b>. With
    <b>numeric</b> you can type a number directly into the control or you can use the <b>spin</b>
    controls (up and down arrows) to change the value within the specified range. To clear a
    value completely, click the <b>cross</b> button to the right of the control.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##common/text-selection-input.png" style="float: right; width: 250px" />
    The <b>text</b> type controls allow you to select one or more items from a drop-down
    list when you click on them. Whether or not you can specify only one or multiple items
    for a single character is specified in the knowledge-base. The clear one or more
    selected items from the control, click on the cross by the selected character state
    value.
</p>
<h2>Getting help for characters & state values</h2>
<p>
    Normally the author of a knowledge-base will provide information that
    helps you interpret characters and character states. Where help for a character is available,
    the character name will change
    colour to vermilion when you move your mouse cursor over it and the mouse cursor changes
    to an arrow with a question mark.
</p>
<p>
    Where help has been provided for a character, you will also see it (or at least part of it)
    in a tooltip when you move the mouse
    pointer over the character label. Only help text provided for the character itself is
    shown in this tooltip and it may, or may not, include images. If more help - either on
    the character or the associated characters states - is available, then you will see a
    message at the foot of the tooltip which says: "Click for <b>more detailed help</b>".
</p>
<img src="##tombiopath##common/character-help.png" style="float: right; width: 250px" />
<p>
    If you click the mouse when the pointer is over a character for which help is
    provided, a resizeable window appears with the same text as appeared in the 
    tooltip (or sometimes a more expanded version) plus, if they have been provided,
    images and explanations of the permitted character state values.
</p>
<p>
    When a value is selected on a text or ordinal state input control and you can
    see its value on the control, moving the mouse cursor over the value will cause
    help, if available for that state value, to be displayed in a tooltip. Sometimes
    more extensive help is available in the resizeable window described above.
</p>
<h2>A note on how the scores work</h2>
<p>
    Every character state specified by you is matched against the knowledge-base values for that character
    for each taxon. Algorithms (described elsewhere in the software documentation) are used to assign
    a score of between -1 and 1 to indicate how well the state value(s) specified by you match those specified
    for that character for each taxon in the knowledge-base. The knowledge-base can specify a couple of moderating
    values for each character which affect the scores
    for a character/taxon: <b>weight</b> and <b>strictness</b>.
</p>
<p>
    Knowledge-base authors can provide a <b>weight</b> value for any character. It is a value, between 0 and 1, that is
    multiplied against the score. This allows the author of the knowledge-base to assign different
    priorities against different characters. Characters which are very constant, with little variation, and
    very important as diagnostic characters can be assigned a high weighting, whilst those that show a lot
    of variation and which provide less convincing evidence of the identity of a taxon can be given low
    weighting.
</p>
<p>
    Knowledge-base authors can provide a <b>strictness</b> value for numeric (and ordinal) characters. This
    is best explained by example. Suppose a character, body length, is specified in the knowledge-base for
    taxon A as 40-50 mm and for taxon B as 80-90 mm. Now suppose you enter a value of 35 mm.
    If the author specified the greatest
    strictness value for this character, the value you specified, since it is outside the range for both
    taxon A and taxon B, would score -1 for both of them (unweighted). But isn't it more likely to
    be indicative of taxon A than taxon B? In many cases you would wish to score taxon A higher than
    taxon B in such cases and a strictness value allows knowledge-base authors to do that. By specifying
    a lower value of strictness, non-matching numeric (and ordinal) characters that miss, but are quite
    close, score higher than those that miss by more. For high strictness values, this latitude is small
    and in for low strictness values, the latitude is wide.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>overall</b> score for each taxon in the knowledge base, indicating how well it matches the
    values you specify, is simply calculated by adding up all the individual character matching scores
    for that taxon.
