<h2>The <i>Side by Side Comparison</i> visualisation (vis3)</h2>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##vis3/resources/compare.png" style="float: right; width: 300px" />
    This visualisation is not a key but it is, none-the-less, a visualisation for exploring a taxonomic
    knowledge-base and a useful tool for comparing and identifying taxa.
    The premise is to provide a means of viewing information contained in the
    knowledge-base for two or more taxa side-by-side and facilitating comparison of them.
</p>
<p>
    When the tool is first invoked you see a single table column
    which lists all of the characters in the knowledge-base
    that are marked for use in visualisations. Select taxa from the 
    taxon selection control to the left of this (described below)
    to display the corresponding character state
    values for those taxa.
</p>
<p>
    This is where the tool comes into its own - the cells in the columns representing the
    character state values for the taxa are coloured to reflect a comparison between
    the taxa which means that commonalities and differences between taxa can be
    picked out at a glance.
</p>
<p>
    The taxon on the left is that against which any other taxa in the table
    are compared. As such, all the cells in for this taxon are coloured either
    blue or white: blue is used for any characters in the knowledge-base that have
    a characters state specified for this taxon and white is used where either no value
    is specified or where the character is not applicable for this taxon.
</p>
<p>
    The cells for all taxa to the right of the first taxon are coloured on the basis
    of a comparison between their character state values and those specified for
    the first taxon. Exact matches are coloured blue whilst those that do not
    match at all are coloured vermillion.Partial matches are coloured intermediately
    depending on the degree of overlap/closeness.
</p>
<p>
    The order in which the taxa are presented in the table can be changed simply by dragging
    the taxon's coloumn header (containing the taxon's name) to a different position
    in the table. If you drag a taxon so that it becomes the first taxon column in
    the table, then <i>it</i> becomes the one against which all others are compared.
</p>
<h2>Context menu</h2>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##vis3/resources/context-menu.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px" />
    The context menu, which can be invoked by right-clicking the mouse with the
    cursor anywhere in this visualisation,
    provides access to some very handy methods for selecting taxa for comparison.
    But the first item in the menu is
    <b>Get URL for side by side comparison view</b> that builds a URL which can be used to reproduce the
    page as you have configured it. For example comparing some specific taxa.
</p>

<p>
    The item <b>Rank those shown against first</b> will re-order whatever
    taxa are currently displayed so that those matching the first taxon most
    closely are closest to it and those that differ most are furthest away.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>Show all</b> item creates a column for every taxon in the knowledge base. You
    will probably only consider using this if there are relatively few taxa in the
    knowledge-base. The corresponding <b>Remove all</b> item removes all taxa
    from the display.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>Show closest <i>*num*</i> to first</b> items are ideal when you have
    already selected a single taxon and you want to display the <i>*num*</i>
    taxa from the knowledge-base that most closely match it.
    It's a great way of exploring a taxon to see what other
    taxa it could most likely be confused with.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>Show top <i>*num*</i> from key</b> items are designed to be used in
    conjunction with other key-type visualisations. Where a key visualisation
    has been used to rank taxa against charcter state input supplied by you,
    you can switch to this visualisation and then quickly select the top
    <i>*num*</i> taxa matching your input in order to compare them in this
    visualisation.
</p>
<h2>Displaying images</h2>
<p>
    If at least one picture for a taxon has been specified in the knowledge-base then a small
    camera icon will be visible in the first cell under the header cell representing that taxon.
    Clicking this will open an image group in the cell where you can see and compare
    images for taxa. Images can be resized by
    changing the width of a taxon column by dragging the right margin of the header cell
    to the right. When you change the width of one taxon column in this way, the widths of
    all the other taxon columns are changed so that they have the same width.
