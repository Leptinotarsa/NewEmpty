<h2>The <i>Two-column Key</i> visualisation (vis1)</h2>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##vis1/resources/two-column.png" style="float: right; width: 300px" />
    This visualisation lays a multi-access key over a taxonomic knowledge-base. It has a simple two-column design
    that separates taxa into more and less likely groups when matched against character state
    values supplied by you. The more likely group - <b>Evidence balance positive</b> - consists of those
    taxa  where the overall score is greater than one. The less likely
    group - <b>Evidence balance negative</b> - consists of those taxa where the overall score is less
    than one. (See below for a bit more about how scoring works.)
</p>
<p>
    The visualisation also allows you to represent the taxa with a picture (see below) - so it's a nice
    one to use if you want a multi-access key where the taxa are represented with a picture.
</p>
<p>
    Each taxon is represented by a rectangle and the numbers which appear in
    the top left of these rectangles indicate the overall matching score (overall 'for' score minus the overall
    'against' score). These are also coloured to give a quick visual reference: blue indicates
    the best overall matching score and vermilion the worst, whilst an overall matching score of zero is
    coloured pale yellow. Intermediate scores are shown with intermediate colours. Taxa are ranked
    in each list according to their scores with the best matches appearing at the top.
</p>
<p>
    As you move the mouse pointer over the name of a taxon a tooltip is shown with an image of
    the taxon (only if at least one picture for a taxon has been specified in the knowledge-base).
    If you find these distracting, you can turn them off by right-clicking the mouse in the visualisation
    and selecting <b>remove taxon image tooltips</b>. You can turn them back on again by repeating and
    selecting the <b>display taxon image tooltips</b> item.
</p>
<p>
    As you specify character states, those taxa appearing at the top of the 'evidence balance
    positive' column (on the left) are those which are the most likely matches.
    The more states you specify, and the
    higher this score (and more characters you specify), the more reliable the match is.
</p>
<h2>In-line images</h2>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##vis1/resources/in-line-image.png" style="float: right" />
    If at least one picture for a taxon has been specified in the knowledge-base then clicking on
    the rectangle representing the taxon will cause the rectangle to expand to accommodate
    an 'in-line' picture. If more than one picture is specified in the knowledge-base then the one with the
    highest specified 'priority' is displayed.
</p>
<p>
    A short-cut to expand <i>all</i> taxon rectangles for which a picture is available is to
    right-click the mouse in the visualisation to see the context menu. Select the
    <b>Expand all taxon items</b> item from the context menu. Note that if the key is
    implemented on the Internet, then it could take a while for all the pictures to
    be streamed down, but you can carry on working with the key whilst this happens in
    the background. Similarly a context menu item to contract all rectangles, hiding the
    pictures, is available when at least one image is displayed - <b>Contract all taxon items</b>.
</p>
<h2>Right-click context menu</h2>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##vis1/resources/context-menu.png" style="float: right" />
    As with all visualisations in this tool, important functionality is often made available
    from a context menu which can be invoked by right-clicking the mouse when the pointer
    is anywhere within the visualisation. The first option is <b>Get URL for two-column key</b>.
    Selecting this menu item builds a URL that can be used to reproduce the
    page as you have configured it.
    The remaining functions available from the context menu for this
    visualisation have been described elsewhere in the relevant sections.
