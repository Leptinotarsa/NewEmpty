<h2>The <i>Single-column Key</i> visualisation (vis2)</h2>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##vis2/resources/one-column.png" style="float: right; width: 300px" />
    This visualisation lays a multi-access key over a taxonomic knowledge-base. Taxa,
    represented by rectangles, are ranked
    in the column according to how well they match any characters states you specify,
    with the best overall matches appearing at the top. This visualisation is
    particularly useful if you want to explore how character states you specify
    match against each of the taxa because every score for each taxon/character
    combination is displayed (as described next).
</p>
<p>
    As you move the mouse pointer over the name of a taxon a tooltip is shown with an image of
    the taxon (only if at least one picture for a taxon has been specified in the knowledge-base).
    If you find these distracting, you can turn them off by right-clicking the mouse in the visualisation
    and selecting 'remove taxon image tooltips'. You can turn them back on again by repeating and
    selecting the 'display taxon image tooltips' item.
</p>
<p>
    Each time you specify a state value(s) for a character, the matching score for that
    character, for each taxon, is displayed in a circle in the rectangle. Scores can
    range between -1 and 1. By default the <b>unweighted scores</b> are displayed, but you
    can change this to display the <b>weighted scores</b> by right-clicking your mouse, with
    the mouse cursor anywhere within the visualisation, to invoke <b>context-menu</b> that
    allows you to switch between weighted and unweighted scores. For more information on
    how scores are calculated and what weighting does, see a later section. On the left-hand
    side of each taxon rectangle is a small coloured rectangle indicating the
    <b>overall weighted matching score</b> for the taxon.
</p>

<p>
    The background colour of the circles containing the character/taxon scores changes
    to give a quick visual reference for the scores: blue indicates
    the best overall matching score for that character and vermilion the worst, whilst a score of zero is
    coloured pale yellow. Intermediate scores are shown with intermediate colours. The same
    is true of the colour of the rectangles with the overall matching scores for the taxon.
</p>
<p>
    If you click on any of the circles showing the taxon/character scores, a window appears
    containing more details of the value of the character in the knowledge-base for this taxon,
    the weighting and
    strictness (if applicable) applying to this character, the state value(s)
    you have specified and both the weighted and unweighted scores.
</p>
<p>
    If at least one picture for a taxon has been specified in the knowledge-base then a small
    camera icon will be visible on the left of the rectangle representing that taxon.
    Clicking this will open an 'image group' for this taxon as a separate
    window. (See 'Working with image groups' below.)

<h2>Right-click context menu</h2>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##vis2/resources/context-menu.png" style="float: right" />
    As with all visualisations in this tool, important functionality is often made available
    from a context menu which can be invoked by right-clicking the mouse when the pointer
    is anywhere within the visualisation. The first option is <b>Get URL for single-column key</b>.
    Selecting this menu item builds a URL that can be used to reproduce the
    page as you have configured it.
    The remaining functions available from the context menu for this
    visualisation have been described elsewhere in the relevant sections.
