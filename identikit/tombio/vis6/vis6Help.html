<h2>The <i>Mobile Key</i> visualisation (vis6)</h2>
<p>
    This visualisation is a multi-access key with a 'mobile-first' design. Taxa,
    represented by rectangles, are ranked
    according to how well they match any character states you specify,
    with the best overall matches appearing at the top.
</p>
<p>
    Each taxon is represented by a rectangle with two numbers in
    the top-right. The first number indicates how many of the currently specified characters
    'match' the values in the knowledge-base for the taxon. (In this case 'match' means any positive score.)
    The second number shows the overall matching score (overall 'for' score minus the overall
    'against' score). These are also coloured to give a quick visual reference: blue indicates
    the best overall matching score and vermilion the worst, whilst an overall matching score of zero is
    coloured pale yellow. Intermediate scores are shown with intermediate colours. Taxa are ranked
    in each list according to their scores with the best matches appearing at the top.
</p>
<p>
    If you click the question mark icon to the right of the scores, a page is shown that gives
    more detail on how each score was calculated.
</p>
<p>
    Three filters above the rectangles representing the taxa allow you to filter the taxa. The
    first of these - <i>All</i> - displays all taxa. The second - <i>Matched</i> - limits the dsplay to only those taxa
    where the number of matching characters is the same as the number of characters specified by
    the user. The final one - <i>Discounted</i> - limits the display to only those taxa where the number
    of matching characters is less than the number specified by the user.
</p>
<p>
    As you specify character states, those taxa appearing at the top of the 'evidence balance
    positive' column (on the left) are those which are the most likely matches.
    The more states you specify, and the
    higher this score, the more reliable the match is.
</p>
<h2>Character input</h2>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##vis6/resources/icons1.jpg" style="float: right" />
    Specifying values for character input is intutive. If the character input panel is not visible, either tap the
    keyboard icon, or swipe right from the left-hand side of the display. The input panel can be 'pinned'
    by tapping the pin icon, or removed by either swiping left or tapping the back arrow.
</p>
<h2>Species accounts</h2>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##vis6/resources/taxon-info-tabs.jpg" />
    Tapping on a taxon name invokes a tabbed species accounts page that can include the
    following tabs:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Knowledge-base values - details of the knowledge, e.g. character state values,
            for that taxon in the knowledge-base underlying the key.
        </li>
        <li>
            Images - any images provided for the taxa are available here.
        </li>
        <li>
            NBN Atlas - distribution maps downloaded from the NBN Atlas via a web
            service. (This tab is not shown if the knowledge-base developer has
            not provided links to the NBN Atlas.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Info - supplementary textual information about the taxa, e.g. species descriptions.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Using as an offline app</h2>
<p>
    This key is a 'Progressive Web App' (PWA) which brings two advantages:
    <ol>
        <li>
            It can be installed and used like a app on a mobile phone, for example
            being invoked from an app icon on the homescreen.
        </li>
        <li>It can be used offline - i.e. where there is no internet connection.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<h3>Installing as an app</h3>
<p>
    This app can be run from any mobile device that supports a modern internet browser,
    such as Chrome, by navigating to the web address in the browser in the usual way.
    On platforms with full support for PWA's you will be offered the option of adding
    an icon for the app to the homescreen.
</p>
<p>
    The image below shows the prompt that appears on and Android phone (at
    the bottom of the screen) when you navigate to the app in the Chrome
    web browser. 
</p>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##vis6/resources/addapp1.jpg" style="width: 250px" />
</p>
<p>
    The image below shows the confirmation prompt that appears on and Android phone
    running Chrome when you indicate that you want to add the app to the homescreen.
    
</p>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##vis6/resources/addapp2.jpg" style="width: 250px" />
</p>
<p>
    Once installed on Android, the icon will be visible in your apps, just as if you had installed
    from the Play Store. As when installing from the app store, you may then
    have to move the icon to your homescreen.
</p>
<p>
    Support for PWAs on iOS normally lags a little behind Android and the experience
    on iPhone will depend on your iOS version, but should be similar.
</p>
<h3>Using offline</h3>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##vis6/resources/menu.jpg" style="float: right" />
    To use the app offline, you need to first download the apps resources before
    going into the field whilst you still have an internet connection. Invoke the
    main menu by tapping the menu icon and then select the 'Offline options' item
    towards the bottom of the menu.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##vis6/resources/download-button.jpg" style="float: right" />
    Tap the 'Download for offline use' button to download all images and text
    files associated with the app. Note that NBN distribution maps, if they
    are included with the app, cannot be bulk-downloaded in this way, but any
    that you load individually whilst in range of wifi will remain available
    to you when offline.
