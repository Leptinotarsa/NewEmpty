<h2>The <i>Circle-pack Key</i> visualisation (vis5)</h2>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##vis5/resources/circle-pack.png" style="float: right; width: 300px" />
    This visualisation can be used as a multi-access key with a taxonomic knowledge-base and it
    is particularly suitable for knowledge-bases that specify that taxonomic hierarchy for the
    taxa included in it.
</p>
<p>
    Note that although some features of this visualisation will work on mobile devices such as iPads,
    it is primarily designed to work on large format mouse-driven devices like laptops.
</p>
<p>
    The circle-pack design keeps taxa that are closely related to each other
    together in the display, whatever their overall matching scores. So, for example, all taxa
    of a given genus are displayed within a circle that represents that genus, and all genera that
    belong to a particular family are displayed together within a circle that represents that
    family.
</p>
<p>
    The visualisation also deals quite nicely with large numbers of taxa, up to a few hundred, so
    it can be a particularly good way to visualise taxonomic groups of that size.
</p>
<p>
    Each taxon is represented by a circle which grows or shrinks in size to reflect the overall
    matching score of the taxon in response to user input. The colours of the taxa circles also
    change to reflect the matching score of each. Blue indicates
    the best overall matching score and vermilion the worst, whilst an overall matching score of zero is
    coloured pale yellow. Intermediate scores are shown with intermediate colours.
    The score itself can be seen by moving the
    mouse over any particular circle representing a taxon.
    So the larger, and bluer, the circle, the better match it is to the specified user input.
</p>
<p>
    The circles of the highest ranking taxa at any time are outlined in a dashed thicker line (rather
    than the solid thinner line of all other taxa.)
</p>
<p>
    You can use the mouse wheel to zoom this visualisation in or out and pan around by
    dragging with your mouse.
</p>
<p>
    Taxon names are,
    by default, abbreviated so that they fit, more or less, within the bounds of the circle that
    represents them. So as a circle gets smaller, the name becomes more abbreviated until, for
    very small circles, it disappears altogether. The full name of any taxon (or taxonomic group)
    represented by a circle will appear as a 'tool tip' whenever the mouse is moved over a circle,
    regardless of the level of abbreviation used.
</p>

<h2>Right-click context menu</h2>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##vis5/resources/context-menu.png" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 0 0" />
    As with all visualisations in this tool, important functionality is often made available
    from a context menu which can be invoked by right-clicking the mouse when the pointer
    is anywhere within the visualisation.
</p>
<p>
    The first option is <b>Get URL for circle-pack key</b>.
    Selecting this menu item builds a URL that can be used to reproduce the
    page as you have configured it.
</p>
<p>
    The name abbreviation feature can be toggled on/off from this menu. When off, then
    full name of each taxon is displayed regardless of the size of the circle.
</p>
<p>
    You can also use this menu to 'ignore higher taxa' which will result is each taxa
    being represented by a circle that is not bound to it's siblings (e.g. species
    within a genus) by a higher level enclosing circle. When higher taxa are ignored,
    the result is that better matching taxa are displayed closer to the centre of
    the visualisation.
</p>
<p>
    There can be a number of further menu items that will display labels for higher
    level taxonomic groupings rather than the lowest level taxa. So for example you
    can display labels for the circles representing genera rather than species. (Note
    that only those taxonomic levels encoded in the knowledge-base will be represented
    by menu items.)
</p>
<p>
    If you select the 'display taxon image tooltips' item, then as you pass the mouse
    pointer over a taxon, the tooltip which displays the name of the taxon and the
    current 'overall score' will be enlarged to include an image of the taxon if one
    has been registered in the knowledge base. When displayed thus, the same menu
    item is altered to become 'remove taxon image tooltips' and selecting it will
    return the taxon tooltips to their original condition.
